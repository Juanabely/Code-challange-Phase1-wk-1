##This are three apps that are:
1:suppose to calculate the grade of a stutent i.e(gradingapp.js)
2:suppose to calculate the speed i.e(speeddetector.js)
3:suppose to calculate the tax of an individual
All of the above code was done by control flow and this were met by conditions
The code has been done in a very tidy way so very easy to understand
to run the code i used an extension on vs code called (code runner)
To check the code i used the console.log to confirm the return values.
